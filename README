# Try to use /bin/sh to run commands
SHELL=/bin/sh
#
# Update the PDB archive every Wednesday at 11:20am. No longer necessary!
#20 11 * * 3 /project/StruPPi/BiO/DBd/PDB/update.sh

# Update the PDB-REMEDIATED archive every Thursday at 11:20am.
#20 14 * * 4 /project/StruPPi/BiO/DBd/PDB-REMEDIATED/update.sh
